## Market Making Simulator
This project implements a basic market-making strategy on Level 2 (L2) order book data. It is structured as a Python notebook and designed to simulate quoting, execution, and inventory management in a high-frequency trading environment. The simulator aims to help understand and evaluate simple market-making behaviors under realistic market conditions.

The historical order book data used in this project was downloaded and formatted following the method described in [this article by Lu Battistoni](https://medium.com/@lu.battistoni/how-to-download-and-format-free-historical-order-book-dataset-16b3a84a8e0e).
